## INTRODUCTION

The Task Manager Web Application is a mini project developed using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**. This application provides a platform for users to create and manage task lists and individual tasks effectively. Users can categorize tasks under different lists, update task status, and organize their to-dos in a structured way. The system supports editing, deleting, and prioritizing tasks, helping users maintain productivity and focus.

---

## KEY FEATURES

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy task and list management.
- **Task List Grouping:** Users can create multiple lists to group tasks by project or category.
- **Dynamic Task Handling:** Add, edit, mark complete/incomplete, or delete tasks.
- **Status Updates:** Change task status and track progress dynamically.
- **Data Storage & Retrieval:** All tasks and lists are stored in the database for persistent access.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Reusable Components:** Consistent UI design with reusable layouts and navigation.

---

## HOW IT WORKS

### Concepts & Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Server Environment:** XAMPP (Apache + MySQL + PHP)

---

## FUNCTIONAL FLOW

1. User signs up and logs into the system securely.
2. User creates a task list (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "College").
3. Within each list, user adds tasks with titles, descriptions, and optional due dates.
4. Tasks can be updated (edited), marked as completed, or deleted.
5. All lists and tasks are saved in the database and retrieved dynamically when the user logs in.
6. A live task dashboard displays active and completed tasks for better task tracking.

---

## DASHBOARD

The system includes an **dashboard** (`index.php`) to monitor and manage users and their task data. Admins can:

- Overview of all task lists created by the user
- Easy access to add, edit, or delete tasks
- Quick status updates (e.g., mark tasks as complete)
- Real-time tracking of pending and completed tasks
- Seamless navigation across lists and task sections

---

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- Web Browser (Google Chrome recommended)
- Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)
- PHPMyAdmin for Database Management

---

## CREDITS

This project is a part of the Web Programming subject (3160713) under Gujarat Technological University. Special thanks to **Prof. Lipi Kothari** for guidance and support.

## TEST CASES

| Test Case        | Expected Output                   | Status |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Create Task List | Allows creation of new task list  | Pass   |
| Add Task         | Adds a task under selected list   | Pass   |
| Edit/Delete Task | Successfully updates/removes task | Pass   |
| Complete Task    | Marks task as completed           | Pass   |

---

## LIMITATIONS

- No real-time notifications or reminders
- No calendar integration
- Limited to single-user usage; no team collaboration features

---

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- Add real-time notifications and task reminders
- Integrate calendar view for task scheduling
- Add task priority levels and sorting options
- Enable drag-and-drop task rearrangement
- Add analytics to track task productivity
- Enable multi-user collaboration (shared task lists)
- Release as a mobile app (using React Native or Flutter)

---

## CONCLUSION

The **Task Manager Web Application** provides a simple and efficient solution for managing personal tasks. With a clear UI and structured backend, it supports the creation and categorization of tasks under multiple lists, allowing users to stay organized and productive. The project emphasizes core web development concepts such as CRUD operations, and MySQL integration, making it a valuable learning experience for building real-world applications.
